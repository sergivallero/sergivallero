# Hi there, my name is Sergio Garc√≠a 
### C++ videogame programmer specialized in UE4/5 & Unity
I'm a former student currently developing my own private projects while looking for a job.

I've always been passionate about videogames so I decided to make a living by creating them. In order to achieve that goal, I studied and graduated from ESAT, Valencia, obtaining an HND in Computing Videogames Programming.

The vast majority of my projects are private, some because of them being academic works, the rest being just private projects I wish I could publish/monetize in the future.

## Some of my most relevant projects 
### [Insurrection: Cyborgs Awakening](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1986800/Insurrection_Cyborgs_Awakening/)
