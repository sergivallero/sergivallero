# Hi there, my name is Sergio Garc√≠a 
### C++ videogame programmer specialized in UE4/5 & Unity
I'm a former student currently developing my own private projects while looking for a job.

I've always been passionate about videogames so I decided to make a living by creating them. In order to achieve that goal, I studied and graduated from ESAT, Valencia, obtaining an HND in Computing Videogames Programming.

The vast majority of my projects are private, some because of them being academic works, the rest being just private projects I wish I could publish/monetize in the future.

## Some of my most relevant projects 
### [Insurrection: Cyborgs Awakening](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1986800/Insurrection_Cyborgs_Awakening/)

In this project I worked as part of Chonky Wave, collaborating with other 3 programmers, 5 artists and a designer to bring this game to live as our final project at ESAT. [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlmQj7hpYkc&ab_channel=ESATVALENCIA)

Here i worked programming several aspects of the game and sometimes taking some design decisions when it comes to mechanics design. 
Melee Combo System: I worked on the combo system, adjusting the hitbox and damage frames of each animation, as well as managing the proper animations for each combo using Animation Montages. Also worked on defense & parry mechanics and basically all the basic player actions.
Destructible objects: Using the Apex System form Unreal 4.26 I made some objects whose mesh can be destroyed by player's attacks, each of them have its own health and can be affected by enemies too.
Throwables & explosives: Other props i worked on are the explosive/throwable ones. Ones are objects that can be picked up and thrown to enemies, typical in Beat 'em up games, and the other ones can be triggered by dealing damage which causes them to explode after a delay, dealing damage or other effects such as a slow
Pickups: The creation, spawn & interaction with player for the pick ups that may be dropped when destroying the scenario or defeating enemies, such as health, 1up, or ultimate charge.
Camera: The camera movement & lock/unlock for the fight scenes, also for the proper working on the 2 player mode.
Boss AI: The final boss is different from the rest of the enemies, here I made use of the behavior trees and tasks system of Unreal Engine, in order to make a fight as interesting as possible, with several phases and different attacks
And other many small things... üòé (not as interesting as the mentioned above)

### [Horchatita Engine](https://youtu.be/jGy42D6UbwM)
<img alt="horchatita engine capture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergivallero/sergivallero/main/horchatita_engine.png">

This 3D engine was made by [ASMinlok](https://github.com/ASMinlok) and me as an academic project. 
It is entirely made on C++ & OpenGL. The UI is made using ImGui and Scripting via Lua is available to create/remove entities, edit their position and values (ie, type of light, rotation, etc.), save or load the current scene or add new meshes/textures from disk. Code is not available as it is an academic project now property of ESAT.

### [Vehicle control, damage & vehicle AI](https://youtu.be/wlOvzNtwCPg) Unreal Engine 5
<img alt="car demo capture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergivallero/sergivallero/main/UE5_cardemo.png">

This one is just one of the projects I created for testing some of the new features of Unreal Engine 5. I ended up making some car controllers in which I imlemented mesh deformation for car damage and made a basic AI which could make use of the car controller created. Assets are not mine. 

### Coming soon

Right now I am working on an Unreal Enine demo which will be uploaded as a public repo and a demo of my ‚ú®own game‚ú® made in Unity which will soon have something worth watching and maybe, who knows, maybe I will trick someone in the future to invest on that huh?
